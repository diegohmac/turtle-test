#Explanation of architecture

- I used React as the framework cause it gives me agility

#If you had more time, what would you like to improve?

- Well, if I had more time I would like to improve the overall style, since I'm not a UI/UX developer, I would do more search and gather some references to improve it. I would create a theme for the layout and test the application to get 100% coverage. Also It would be cool to create a simple back-end in Node to take care of the database and use websockets to get a better user experience in the chat screen.
